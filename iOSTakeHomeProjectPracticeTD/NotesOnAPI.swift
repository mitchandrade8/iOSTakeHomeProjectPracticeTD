// MARK: - REST API

// REST: Representational State Transfer

// API: Application Programming Interface
/// Set of protocols to interact with a service 


// An API is like a black box:
/// You do not know the actual code is to make it work but you do that you can call certain definitions within to interact with it

/// Think of it like a delivery service app, you do not know how uber eats works behind the scenes but they provide you with all the
/// tools to easily order a big mac.
